# MAGIC: Measurement-error adjusted local genetic correlation method
# Introduction
MAGIC is a method for evaluating trans-ethnic genetic correlation of associated SNPs. Suppose we have yielded a set of uncorrected associated SNPs for a trait and let the estimated SNP marginal effect size on the trait be &beta;. Because of the finite sample size, &beta; trends to be intrinsic to estimation error compared to the true effect size α. To account for this uncertainty, we model &beta; within the measurement error framework with a signal-noise model: &beta;=&alpha;+ε, where ε is the measurement error which also reflects the estimation error.
