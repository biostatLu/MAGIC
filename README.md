# MAGIC: Measurement-error adjusted local genetic correlation method
# Introduction
MAGIC is a method for evaluating trans-ethnic genetic correlation of associated SNPs. Suppose we have yielded a set of uncorrected associated SNPs for a trait and let the estimated SNP marginal effect size on the trait be &alpha;. Because of the finite sample size,   trends to be intrinsic to estimation error compared to the true effect size α. To account for this uncertainty, we model   within the measurement error framework with a signal-noise model (Buonaccorsi, 2010):  , where ε is the measurement error which also reflects the estimation error.
